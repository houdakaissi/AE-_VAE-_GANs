# AE-_VAE-_GANs
## Objective :
The main purpose behind this lab is to get familiar with Pytorch library, to build
deep neural network architecture for Auto-encoder, Variational Auto-encoder and GAN
## Part 1: Autoencoder and Variational Autoencoder (AE and VAE)
1. Establish an auto-encoder Architecture then train the model on MINST Dataset  
2. Establish an Variational auto-encoder Architecture then train your model on MINST Dataset
3. Evaluate the two models by plotting (Loss, KL divergence, etc), what you conclude.
4. Try to plot the latent space of the two models
## Part 2: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
#### 1. GAN Architecture and Training
Both Generator and Discriminator were trained effectively, with the Generator progressively improving its ability to generate realistic abstract art images
#### 2. Model Evaluation and Conclusion
Plotting Loss: Both Generator and Discriminator loss curves converged, indicating successful training
#### 3. Data Generation and Quality Comparison
Generated images from the trained Generator were visually inspected and compared with original images.
   ## Conclusion
   Overall, this lab successfully introduced and implemented Autoencoder, Variational Autoencoder, and Generative Adversarial Networks using PyTorch library. Each model showcased unique strengths and capabilities, providing valuable insights into the world of generative AI.
